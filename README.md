# 🎁 New Features Button - Concept Gallery

An interactive prototype exploring different enhancement concepts for the "New Features" button in OpenGov products.

---

## 📋 Overview

**What is this?**  
This is a **non-functional prototype** designed to explore and visualize different approaches to feature announcements and user adoption. It demonstrates how the existing "New Features" button could be enhanced to improve user engagement, education, and feature discovery.

**Purpose:**  
- Visualize 9 distinct enhancement concepts in an interactive gallery (plus a full experience combining all)
- Allow stakeholders to evaluate different strategies side-by-side
- Provide detailed behavioral descriptions for each concept
- Enable rapid iteration on design and UX patterns

**Important:** This prototype uses **fake data** and does not connect to any real systems. All interactions, metrics, and timers are simulated for demonstration purposes only.

## 📸 Current State: The Existing View

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/existing-view.png" alt="Existing New Features Dropdown" width="500">
  <p><em>The current "New Features" button with a basic dropdown list and toggle switches.</em></p>
</div>

**Current Functionality:**
- Simple dropdown with feature list
- Toggle switches to enable/disable features
- No badges, timers, or additional engagement mechanisms
- No links to documentation or roadmaps

**Challenge:** How can we make feature discovery more engaging, educational, and effective?
