# 🎁 New Features Button - Concept Gallery

An interactive prototype exploring different enhancement concepts for the "New Features" button in OpenGov products. This project demonstrates how to transform feature discovery from a simple notification into an engaging, educational experience.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This is a mock **component gallery** showcasing different approaches to feature announcements and adoption. Each variant demonstrates a unique enhancement concept, allowing stakeholders to evaluate and choose the most effective strategies for their use case.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/moti-og/new-features-ads.git
cd new-features-ads

# Open in your browser (no build required!)
open index.html
```

That's it! The prototype runs entirely in your browser with no dependencies or setup needed.
